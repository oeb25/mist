import { MintPlayground } from "../../components/MintPlayground";

## Background

In the past I've used [LALRPOP](https://github.com/lalrpop/lalrpop/) as my go-to
for anything parsing. You can read more about my experience
[here](/posts/2023-01-31-lalrpop). For parsing in Mint, however, I wanted to try
something new.

<MintPlayground client:only="react" />

## Error reporting

<MintPlayground
  client:only="react"
  src={[
    "let x = 12;",
    "",
    "fn main() {",
    "    let x = 12",
    "    let y = 13;",
    "}",
  ].join("\n")}
/>
