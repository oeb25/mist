import { MintPlayground, SAMPLES } from "../../components/MintPlayground";

In the past I've used [LALRPOP](https://github.com/lalrpop/lalrpop/) as my go-to
for anything parsing. You can read more about my experience
[here](/posts/2023-01-31-lalrpop). For parsing in Mint, however, I wanted to try
something new.

For a quick spoiler, checkout this is demo of what we are working towards:

<MintPlayground client:only="react" large src={SAMPLES.euclid} />

## Concrete syntax trees

Concrete syntax trees are a way of representing parsed source code in a
structured way, where no information about its original structure is lost. This
is in contrast to abstract syntax trees, which more directly represent the
constructs of a parsed file, but leaves out elements such as spaces and
semicolons.

There are positives and negatives to concrete syntax trees, but their primary
strength is retaining source locations and superfluous language constructs (such
as comments). Additionally, they allow for constructing partial syntax trees,
when the input for example contains errors. Thus in the context of an IDE
experience, the tooling can still provide meaningful annotation while the
program might contain syntax errors.

Another point is that they allow for efficient tree rewriting while holding on
to source locations, comments, and similar. This makes them good for mutating
source code with features such as refactoring or code completion, something that
is hard to do if your toolchain only works with complete and valid source
programs.

Now, I'm mentioning these as benefits of concrete syntax trees, but in fact
these are more the things they enable, and what libraries choose to do with
them; which brings us to the next point.

## Error reporting

<MintPlayground
  client:only="react"
  src={[
    "let x = 12;",
    "",
    "fn main() {",
    "    let x = 12",
    "    let y = 13;",
    "}",
  ].join("\n")}
/>
