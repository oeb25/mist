This is a demo page for interacting with [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) in
the browser through [WASM](https://webassembly.org/).

<Z3Playground client:only="react" />

## How does this work?

_Well not great... And maybe only in Chrome (and Firefox?)._

Z3 is a [SMT
solver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability_modulo_theories) written in
C++. While C++ does not natively run in the browser, WebAssembly enables a
native-like execution environment by compiling with a special compiler like
[Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/).

Fortunately Z3 provides [this as a package on
npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/z3-solver). It is, however, a little bit
finicky to get working with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (the frontend tooling I
prefer). This is because it is made to load the wasm file at runtime, and Vite
only bundles the files you explicitly tell it to.

I've [written about
it](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/discussions/6551#discussioncomment-4852578)
on the z3 repo discussions, and I think that this is an area where we could take
inspiration from how [wasm-pack](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack) exports
for bundlers.
