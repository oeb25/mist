import { MintPlayground } from "../../components/MintPlayground";

Previously I've used [LALRPOP](https://github.com/lalrpop/lalrpop/) for most of
my projects. I love how clean the grammar is, and how easy it is to specify
precedence _(in most cases)_. It allows me to get a parser in just a few hours,
even with decent error reporting!

Where LALRPOP falls short for me, is when there's amiguity in the grammar. You
have to be very particular in how different nonterminals interact, as the
productions inside one will influence the productions inside other nonterminals
where it is used.

To see this in action, take a look at the following small expression language:

```rs
pub Expr: String = {
  #[precedence(level = "0")]
  r"[1-9][0-9]*" => <>.to_string(),
  r"[a-z]+" => <>.to_string(),
  #[precedence(level = "1")]
  Expr "*" Expr => format!("{:?}", (<>)),
  Expr "/" Expr => format!("{:?}", (<>)),
  #[precedence(level = "2")]
  Expr "-" Expr => format!("{:?}", (<>)),
  Expr "+" Expr => format!("{:?}", (<>)),
}
```

So let's see...

```rs
❯ cargo build
   Compiling parsing v0.1.0
error: failed to run custom build command for `parsing v0.1.0`

Caused by:
  process didn't exit successfully: `.../build-script-build` (exit status: 1)

/src/parser.lalrpop:15:2: 15:39: Ambiguous grammar detected

  The following symbols can be reduced in two ways:
    Expr "+" Expr "+" Expr

  They could be reduced like so:
    Expr "+" Expr "+" Expr
    ├─Expr──────┘        │
    └─Expr───────────────┘

  Alternatively, they could be reduced like so:
    Expr "+" Expr "+" Expr
    │        └─Expr──────┤
    └─Expr───────────────┘

  Hint: This looks like a precedence error related to `Expr`. See the LALRPOP manual for
  advice on encoding precedence.

/src/parser.lalrpop:15:2: 15:39: Ambiguous grammar detected

  The following symbols can be reduced in two ways:
    Expr "+" Expr "-" Expr

  They could be reduced like so:
    Expr "+" Expr "-" Expr
    ├─Expr──────┘        │
    └─Expr───────────────┘

  Alternatively, they could be reduced like so:
    Expr "+" Expr "-" Expr
    │        └─Expr──────┤
    └─Expr───────────────┘

  LALRPOP does not yet support ambiguous grammars. See the LALRPOP manual for advice on
  making your grammar unambiguous.

// and so on for all of the other permutations of operators for each precedence ...
```

_These are some nicely formatted errors,_ but errors nonetheless! In this case,
it does now know the associativity of the operators. That is, will `1 - 2 + 3`
be parsed as `(1 - 2) + 3` or `1 - (2 + 3)`? Fortunately, LALRPOP has
`#[assoc(side="left")]` and `#[assoc(side="right")]` annotations!

```rs
pub Expr: String = {
  #[precedence(level = "0")]
  r"[1-9][0-9]*" => <>.to_string(),
  r"[a-z]+" => <>.to_string(),
  #[precedence(level = "1")] #[assoc(side="left")]
  Expr "*" Expr => format!("{:?}", (<>)),
  Expr "/" Expr => format!("{:?}", (<>)),
  #[precedence(level = "2")] #[assoc(side="left")]
  Expr "-" Expr => format!("{:?}", (<>)),
  Expr "+" Expr => format!("{:?}", (<>)),
}
```

Let's try this out with the example above:

```rs
❯ cargo run "1 - 2 + 3"
   Compiling parser v0.1.0
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.44s
     Running `parser '1 - 2 + 3'`
((1, -, 2), +, 3)
```

_Cool, that works!_

Where this breaks down is in larger grammars. I've been working on a parser for
the [Viper](https://www.pm.inf.ethz.ch/research/viper.html) language
[Silver](https://github.com/viperproject/silver). You can see my progress on the
grammar
[here](https://gist.github.com/oeb25/d005407173ac470899ca358c63406bcf#file-silver-lalrpop-L265-L266)
before I stopped working on this version. On line 265 I have a production
commented out for a construct that is ambiguous when written in this style, and
below it is the pseudo-fix. With the ambiguous production enabled, LALRPOP
produces _3711 lines of errors_. And these errors are not limited to `AccExpr`;
they even mess up `if-else` statements which are not part of the `Expr`
nonterminal.

To me, this scenario is a bit of a red flag. Without modularity in the
nonterminals, this means that you in principle have to consider the entire
grammar when adding a single rule. This is a bit of an overstatement, but when
these ambiguity errors do occur, this is how it feels.

With that said, I beleive LALRPOP will remain my first choice when writing a
parser for a small and/or simple language. For more complex languages,
especially where error-ressilient parsing is required, I will consider other
solutions!

But what are the other solutions? In my [next post](2023-02-01-parsing) I
explain the approch I've been trying for Mint.
